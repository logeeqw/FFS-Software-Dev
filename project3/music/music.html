    <h1 class="h1">Béla Bartók</h1>

<div class="content">
    <p>Béla Bartók was a Hungarian composer, pianist, ethnomusicologist, and teacher, noted for the Hungarian
        flavour of his major musical works, which include orchestral works, string quartets, piano solos, several
        stage works, a cantata, and a number of settings of folk songs for voice and piano. Bartók spent his childhood
        and youth in various provincial towns, studying the piano with his mother and later with a succession
        of teachers. Bartók undertook his professional studies in Budapest, at the Royal Hungarian Academy of
        Music, rather than in Vienna. Shortly after Bartók completed his studies in 1903, he and the Hungarian
        composer Zoltán Kodály, who collaborated with Bartók, discovered that what they had considered Hungarian
        folk music and drawn upon for their compositions was instead the music of city-dwelling Roma. Eventually
        Bartók and Kodály's music became intertwined with Hungarian folk music.Bartók was appointed to the faculty
        of the Academy of Music in 1907 and retained that position until 1934, when he resigned to become a
        working member of the Academy of Sciences. His first numbered quartet (1908) shows few traces of folk
        influence, but in the others that influence is thoroughly assimilated and omnipresent. The quartets
        parallel and illuminate Bartók’s stylistic development: in the second quartet (1915–17) Berber (Amazigh)
        elements reflect the composer’s collecting trip to North Africa; in the third (1927) and fourth (1928)
        there is a more intensive use of dissonance; and in the fifth (1934) and sixth (1939) there is a
        reaffirmation of traditional tonality.  During the short-lived proletarian dictatorship of the Hungarian
        Soviet Republic in 1919, he served as a member of the Music Council with Kodály. His most productive years
        were the two decades that followed the end of World War I in 1918, when his musical language was
        completely and expressively formulated. </p>

            <p>As Nazi Germany extended its sphere of influence in the late
        1930s and Hungary appeared in imminent danger of capitulation, Bartók found it impossible to remain
        there. After a second concert tour of the United States in 1940, he immigrated there the same year.
        An appointment as research assistant in music at Columbia University, New York City, enabled him to
        continue working with folk music. With his wife, the pianist Ditta Pásztory, he was able to give a
        few concerts. His health, however, was never very strong and had begun to deteriorate even before
        his arrival in the United States. Bartók’s last years were marked by the ravages of leukemia,
        which often prevented him from teaching, lecturing, or performing. Nonetheless, he was able to
        compose the Concerto for Orchestra (1943), the Sonata for violin solo (1944), and all but the
        last measures of the Piano Concerto No. 3 (1945).</p>
