        <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
        <p>Nuit Noire was founded by Thargret Matcher after her alcoholic husband passed away.
        She wanted a wine that women with alcoholic husbands could drink with those husbands.
        She wanted to save women the sorrow of getting beat by drunk husbands by getting the women
            drunk also. She is now being hailed as a hero, not just for her mission but her wine also.</p>
